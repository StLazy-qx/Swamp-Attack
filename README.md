One of the First Small Projects:

Implemented a State Machine.

Created 2D bullet physics for defense mechanics.

Added TileMap animations.

Optimized the state machine for better scalability.

Introduced object pooling to reduce performance overhead.

Improved wave spawning mechanics and difficulty scaling.

The main focus of UI work was dynamic health indicators and enemy wave counters.

Added a coin counter for defeating enemies.
